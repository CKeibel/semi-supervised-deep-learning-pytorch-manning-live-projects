# Manning - Semi-Supervised Deep Learning with GANs for Melanoma Detection

In this liveProject series, you’ll take on the role of a computer vision engineer creating a proof of concept for an image recognition mobile app—one with world-changing potential. You’ll build a machine learning model that can identify cancerous moles in low-resolution photos from a phone’s camera. To produce the model, you’ll work through different supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning techniques, and use data augmentation to improve your training dataset. Each liveProject in this series covers a different deep learning approach for you to build a toolbox of skills that are most relevant to your career.

**Projects**

 1. Train a Supervised Learning Image Classifier
 2. Semi-Supervised GANs for Melanoma Detection
 3. Generative Modeling with VAEs and GANs
